BTEC Virtual World
The BTEC Virtual World is a modular, microservices‑based environment designed to support AI‑powered assessment, interactive learning, and real‑time business simulations for BTEC programs.
This repository serves as the core submodule for the main BTEC backend platform, providing shared assets, configuration templates, and foundational components used across the system.

🚀 Purpose
The goal of the BTEC Virtual World is to create a scalable, extensible digital ecosystem that supports:
• 	AI‑powered assessment workflows
• 	Interactive business scenarios
• 	Real‑time data processing
• 	Modular microservices integration
• 	Seamless communication with the main backend

🧱 Repository Structure
This repository will eventually include:
• 	Shared configuration files
• 	Simulation templates
• 	AI scenario definitions
• 	Frontend assets for virtual interactions
• 	Microservice‑ready modules

🔗 Integration
This repository is used as a Git submodule inside the main backend:/BTEC-backend └── BTEC-Virtual-World  ← submodule /BTEC-backend └── BTEC-Virtual-World  ← submodule
To initialize the submodule: git submodule update --init --recursive

📌 Status
This is the initial commit.
More components will be added as the Virtual World modules are developed.

📄 License
This project follows the same license as the main BTEC backend
